		<blockquote cite="https://www.noaa.gov/ocean-coasts">
		
			<p>Our ocean and coasts affect us — and we affect them. Almost 40 percent of the country’s population lives in coastal shoreline counties. These counties contribute $9 trillion to the U.S. economy. Climate change, sea level rise, more intense storms, and population growth are all challenges for our coastal communities. The National Ocean Service helps decision makers find solutions. We are the nation’s leader in observing, measuring, assessing, protecting, and managing coastal, ocean, and Great Lakes areas.</p>
